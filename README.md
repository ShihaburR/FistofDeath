# FistofDeath
A 2D 5x5 Grid game with co-ordinates and basic RPG mechanics

Fist of Death is a grid based game in which the player (you) will have to identify in the arena(5x5 grid), a bunch of enemies based on co-ordinates and defeat them with 4 options (3 offensive: Light Attack, Cursed Attack and the GodFist, 1 defensive: Block). There will be a final enemy that will be challenging that will have 100HP instead of the standard 20HP to provide a challenge to the user. The game ends when the player dies or when all enemies are defeated in the grid.

In the fights you always start with 100HP and as every turn progress on the same enemy, you will by default lose 20HP due to fighting the enemy. If you decide to use a input in which manipulates your health e.g. The cursed attack reduces your HP by an extra 10HP or Block which reduces the usual 20HP loss to 10HP.

To start the game, type in your console:

Co-ordinate inputs are (x,y) which are mentioned in the game.
